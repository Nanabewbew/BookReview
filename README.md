# BookReview
I have made this book review app during my development course for the IBM "Developing back-end apps with Node.js and Express." This application allows users to manage books, write reviews, and interact with book-related data. It utilizes MySQL as the database and Sequelize.js as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool.
